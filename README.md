# BoigJob - frontend

This app is meant to track my job search.
The usage is simple: Every time I apply to a job offer I copy-paste the description to a form input, and the rest of the form is filled with LLM AI. Same process when receiving a response from the company.
With the data collected the app displays a dashboard with relevant metrics. It gives insights as: 
Which job-seeking platform gives me a best response ratio?
What skills are wanted for my position?
What has been my performance applying to offers over time?
